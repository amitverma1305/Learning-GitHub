Issues:
Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

Branches:
Branch is used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

GitHub Enterprise
GitHub Enterprise is a self-managed version of GitHub with similar functionality. It can be run on an organisation's own hardware or on a cloud provider, and it has been available since November 2011.

We can use branches to:
Develop features
Fix bugs
Safely experiment with new ideas

Gist
GitHub also operates other services: a pastebin-style site called Gist that is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects).
